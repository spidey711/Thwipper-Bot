# Thwipper-bot

_<h2>游동 What is Thwipper? 游동</h2>_
Everything you need to keep the members of the server entertained, this bot has it. 
Thwipper is inspired from my favorite fictional character Spider-Man. Its name is the onomatopoeia of Spider-Man using his web-shooters. Here is the link to invite: [Thwip!](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=837686974516035644&permissions=36924480&scope=bot)<br>
Prefixes => `_` `t!`<br>

Have the bot token, SQL password, reddit client id, client secret and the user agent in a .env file in the same directory as `main.py`<br>
Make sure you have all the dependencies installed that are required for this bot to work.<br>
Especially `ffmpeg` as it is required to play music.
